      <h4>Apartment Living In Dubai</h4>
      <p>With all the years in the making, the Dubai real estate market now compares closely to leading real estate markets of the world. It is gradually moving away from an oil-based economy and relies less on oil-production in comparison to its neighbors. With its progressive governance, conducive trade environment and massive global appeal, it has grown to become a favorite with overseas investors and this has made the real estate market flourish remarkably from the 2000’s.p>
      <p>Areas like <a class="red-word" href="#">Business Bay</a>, <a class="red-word" href="#">Downtown Dubai</a>, <a class="red-word" href="#">Dubai South</a>, <a class="red-word" href="#">Discovery Gardens</a>, <a class="red-word" href="#">Dubai Marina</a>, <a class="red-word" href="#">Al Barsha South</a> and <a class="red-word" href="#">Al Warsan</a> amongst others remain a favorite amongst renters. The prices depend and vary based on these locations, apartment sizes and whether they are unfurnished or furnished.</p>
      <p>The variation in rental prices range from a studio apartment being available at AED 20,000 - 35,000 per year in Dubailand and International City to AED 70,000 - 85,000 per year in Business Bay and Downtown Dubai.</p>
      <p>To rent a lavish 3-4 bedroom luxury apartment can cost you anything between AED 300,000 - 400,000 a year in Dubai Marina and Downtown Dubai to a whopping AED 700,000 - 750,000 in similar high-end areas.</p>
      <p>Dubai is a fast-evolving modern economy which makes it an ideal destination for trade, investment and living. Naturally, this means your decision to invest in property needs to be well-calculated but it will be profited by a myriad of beneficial opportunities. It all adds up well with its sound legal and administrative system that protects your rights and eliminates any misconduct making it a secure investment hub</p>
